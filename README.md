# Popular-Movies
Second Project for Udacity Android Nanodegree

## Stage 1:
The first stage of this app will:
1. Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2. Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
   - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
3. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
   - original title
   - movie poster image thumbnail
   - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
   - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
   - release date
