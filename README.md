# Popular-Movies
Second Project for Udacity Android Nanodegree

## Stage 1: ##
The first stage of this app will:
1. Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2. Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
   - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
3. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
   - original title
   - movie poster image thumbnail
   - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
   - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
   - release date
   
## Stage 2: ##
Stage 1 of this app will be extended to/by:
1.  Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
2.  Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
3.  Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
4.  Creating a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
5. Modifying the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
